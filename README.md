# DW Drop
This app is meant to add a user's Discover Weekly tracks to a designated playlist once a week in the simplest way possible. After signing in, it only contains a toggle that turns the "drop" on or off. Since this is not currently running on a server, a button must be pressed to initiate the "drop".
